# Movies-similarity-NLP
In this NLP project, I quantified the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separated them into groups aka clusters.
Finally I have created a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.

Processes: Tokenization, Stemming, Create Tfidfvector, Fit and Transform text to vector created, kmeans clustering, Dendogram
