# Movies-similarity-NLP
In this NLP project, the aim is to quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, and cluster them in different groups accordingly. I plotted/created a dendrogram to show which movies are closely related to each other.

Dataset used is Datacamp Project, which consists of plot summaries of 100 movies from Wikipedia and IMDb.
Processes: Tokenization, Stemming, Creating Tfidfvector, Fitting and Transforming text to vector created, kmeans clustering, Dendogram
